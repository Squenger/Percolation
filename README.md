The objective here is to make a theoretical study of the percolationcomma and to verify the results by 2D simulations.an opening is made on percolation in three dimensions which still remains an open subject for mathematics

SImulation:
You can find the main code of simulation named percolation.py. 
If you just want to plot some "percolated map", you can lunch the function display() (there are two optional parameters n the size of the map, and p the probability of percolation)
I you want to plot the figure that shows the phenomena of  phase transition, you can lunch Monte_Carlo() (there are two optinal parameters : n the size of the map, q the number of repetitions for averaging).


Theroy : 
You can find slides (in french) which present the matematical theory of percolation and make some demonstration of probability results. You can also find a lot of comparison between mathematical results and simulations.
